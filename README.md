# PiChi 📸

PiChi (ピチッ) is a simple tool meant to help Japanese language learners save time during their studies. I got tired of spending so much time just looking for example sentences with terms I’m learning to *study later* rather than actually studying them, and this tool was born. 

PiChi saves you time by taking a file of terms and grabbing several example sentences containing each term from [Jisho.org](http://Jisho.org) and dumping them into a file.

## Installation

To use this tool, clone or download the repo and put it somewhere you like.

## Requirements

To use PiChi you’ll need to have node.js installed.

## How to use it

Navigate to the /src/ directory of PiChi is and run `index.js`

```bash
node index.js
```

After it’s done running, all of the content will go into the `/bin/data/generated_files` folder. Export it any way you like!
